Overall, this project aims to create a healthcare website that is tailored to the needs of older people, providing them with reliable and relevant information that will help them to maintain good health and manage chronic conditions.

**Technologies used:**
The project involved developing a web application for a healthcare system. To build the front-end of the application, used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap, which allowed me to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
HTML: HTML was used to structure the content of the application, while CSS was used to style the interface and make it visually appealing.
Javascript: Javascript was used to add interactivity to the application, such as pop-up, form validation, navigating from one page to another page with certain conditions.
Bootstrap and CSS: Bootstrap and CSS framework, provides pre-built styles and components that helped to create a consistent look and feel across the application. Also, used Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and flexbox to ensure that the application was responsive and could adapt to different devices.
