**Project Summary:**
The *OLD FIT* project aims to create a simple and easy-to-understand healthcare website specifically designed for older people. The website will provide comprehensive information about different healthcare topics, including general health and wellness, and chronic disease management. The website has been designed to be user-friendly, with clear and concise language and a straightforward layout. 

The project consists of three pages: a login page, a disease selection page, and a page displaying details of the selected diseases.

**page_1:**
*Collecting information like name, age, height, weight and gender. Once submitted users will be directed to the disease selection page.

**page_2:**
*On the disease selection page, users can select the checkboxes to choose the issue they want to get information. The available diseases include common age-related conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and knee pain as well as other diseases that may be relevant to the older people.
*Once the user selects the diseases they want to get information, they can click on the "Next" button to be directed to the details page.

**page_3 :**
*On this page, users can view detailed information about the diseases they have selected, including symptoms, treatment options, and lifestyle recommendations. The information is presented in a clear and easy-to-understand format, making it accessible to users with varying levels of medical knowledge.
*Validating their weight to tell them whether they are in ideal weight or under weight or over weight. And also providing them with information which they have selected in previous page with corresponding links.

Overall, this project aims to create a healthcare website that is tailored to the needs of older people, providing them with reliable and relevant information that will help them to maintain good health and manage chronic conditions.

**Technologies used:**
The project involved developing a web application for a healthcare system. To build the front-end of the application, used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap, which allowed me to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
HTML: HTML was used to structure the content of the application, while CSS was used to style the interface and make it visually appealing.
Javascript: Javascript was used to add interactivity to the application, such as pop-up, form validation, navigating from one page to another page with certain conditions.
Bootstrap and CSS: Bootstrap and CSS framework, provides pre-built styles and components that helped to create a consistent look and feel across the application. Also, used Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and flexbox to ensure that the application was responsive and could adapt to different devices.
